# Cluster Environment Assignment
This overlay directory contains all clusters that should be applied to cluster environment identified by the parent directory.  
Clusters are specified by creating a new directory in the current path. The directory is named with the store ccn value in lowercase format.  
Within the ccn directory must exist a file named `shw-cluster-CCN.json`, where CCN is substitued with the actual store ccn value.
